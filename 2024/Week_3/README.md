### Thoughts

This was really challenging for me because I had to change my way of thinking. The challenge suggested Unpivoting, and then Pivoting again on a separate column as well as several unions. I already knew that solving these challenges in Snowflake would be different to doing it in Tableau Prep, but I went in with the expection to do the double transformation and this took me ages to let go off. Once I decided to address it right from the Temp table, things wen't much smoother. The main issue was that it seems you can't directl'y use a subquery or dynamic SQL inside the 'PIVOT' clause. I'm glad this is over ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
